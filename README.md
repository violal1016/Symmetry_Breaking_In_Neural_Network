# Symmetry_Breaking_In_Neural_Network
We discuss nonlinear dynamics of optimization landscape of Neural Network in this project. A fully connected two-layer teacher-student architecture with Gaussian input is studied. The activation is Leaky ReLU and the bifurcation parameter is chosen to be leaky slope.
The G.A.P code for S_k=S_5 to find basic degree and maximal orbit types are computed and presented.
